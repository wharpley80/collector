The Street levels come in two categories. The first is to tag every graffiti point in each area previously tagged by a rival gang before the timer runs out while evading the authorities. The second category serves as a boss battle by chasing the rival gang members and spraying graffiti on them. The more graffiti points are sprayed, the more deadly the authorities become. Graffiti points are marked by arrows and require paint to tag them.',

Each fighter is equipped with lock-on lasters, pulse lasers, and a single devastating assault laser array that can destroy all sighted targets as once. Even with this technology at your disposal, the battle will not be easy. Earth\'s forces are depleted, and the merciless hordes of Secilia will settle for nothing less than complete annihilation of Earth. Fortunately, Star command has created two R-GRAY prototypes, so if you need extra firepower, a skilled friend can fly at your side.
